# Ticket Scanner

Eventmie Pro comes with an integrated ticket scanner. Organizers & Admin can scan the event attendees tickets at event entrances directly from the website, using any mobile device or laptop with a web-camera.

<br>

The ticket scanner scans QrCode on the ticket, verify if the ticket is valid, and provides an option to `Check-in` the attendees. Once a ticket is scanned, it can never be scanned again after `Check-in`.

## Ticket PDF <small class="v">v1.5</small>

Before proceeding to the Ticket scanner, let's see the Ticket PDF. Eventmie Pro generates tickets in PDF format with a unique QrCode in each.

- QrCode has got a unique Ticket ID + Order number, which belongs to a single customer's ticket.
- Ticket format is PDF, hence it's compatible by default on all devices.
- QrCode size on the ticket is increased, hence, the scanning is faster, and you don't even need to `Zoom in`.
- `Admin` | `Organizer` | `Customer`, all of them can download tickets from their `Bookings` page.

## Scan & Check-in <small class="v">v1.5</small>

The scanning & Check-in process very smooth. üç∫ 

- Organizers can Scan & Check-in in only their own event's tickets.
- Admin can Scan & Check-in in all events tickets.
- Multi-ticket scans, if in case, a ticket has 3 Attendees (3 Qty), then you can scan the ticket up to 3 times (Max Scan = Qty)
- The Total Scans / Total Quantity will appear on Customer Bookings, Organizer Bookings & Admin Dashboard pages. 
- If the Booking Status = Disabled or if the Booking Is Paid = No, then that ticket won't be scanned & Checked-in.
