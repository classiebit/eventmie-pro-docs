# Ticket Scanner

Eventmie Pro features a powerful, integrated ticket scanner for seamless event check-in. Organizers and Admins can scan attendee tickets at event entrances directly from the website using any mobile device or laptop with a web camera, ensuring fast and secure event access control.

The ticket scanner reads the QR code on each ticket, verifies its validity, and provides a one-click `Check-in` option for attendees. Once a ticket is checked in, it cannot be scanned again, ensuring secure and accurate entry management.

## Scan & Check-in <small class="v">v2.0</small>

The scanning and check-in process is smooth and efficient. The system records the attendee's check-in time for verification and reporting.

- Organizers can scan and check-in tickets for their own events only.
- Admins can scan and check-in tickets for all events.
- Multi-ticket scans: If a ticket has multiple attendees (e.g., 3 Qty), it can be scanned up to 3 times (Max Scan = Qty).
- Total scans and total quantity are displayed on Customer Bookings, Organizer Bookings, and Admin Dashboard pages.
- If the Booking Status is `Disabled` or Booking Is Paid is `No`, the ticket cannot be scanned or checked in.
