# Booking Event's Tickets

Eventmie Pro offers a simple, secure, and lightning-fast event ticket booking and checkout process. ðŸ’ª

In v2.0, we've introduced a time-bound checkout system. A 5-minute checkout timer ensures that selected tickets or seats are reserved for the attendee, allowing them to complete their booking before tickets go out of stock during high-demand sales.

<br>

1. **Customer** can book tickets for any event for themselves.
2. **Admin** can book tickets for any event on behalf of a **Customer**.
3. **Organizer** can book tickets for **THEIR OWN** events only, on behalf of a **Customer**.

## Paid or UnPaid Booking

A new and important `Booking Status` called `Is Paid` (`Yes` or `No`) shows whether the booking amount has been paid by the customer.

<br>

Depending on the payment option, the `Is Paid` status is set as follows:

1. **Free Checkout** â€“ `Is Paid` status is always `Yes`.
2. **Online Payment** â€“ `Is Paid` status is always `Yes`.
3. **Offline Payment** â€“ `Is Paid` status is always `No`.

<br>

After receiving payment for an `Offline Payment`, Admin or Organizer can update the `Is Paid` status to `Yes`.

---

>{primary} If `Is Paid` is `No`, the customer will NOT be able to `Download Tickets` or `Access Online Event Secret Details`.

## Booking Process (under the hood)

Eventmie Pro's booking and checkout process is designed for speed and reliability. Here's what happens behind the scenes:

The booking process is divided into two parts (micro-services):

### Pre-booking process

1. Initiate a progress loader to show checkout progress.
2. Validate the booking; if validation fails, stop the process and display an error.
3. If successful, process the payment.
4. On successful payment, complete the booking process (end pre-booking process).
5. Show a successful payment & booking notification and redirect to the `My Bookings Page`.

---

>{primary} There are separate `My Bookings` pages for Customers, Organizers, and Admins, showing all bookings. See the `Manage Bookings` section for more details.

---

### Post-booking process

1. On the bookings page, initiate a progress loader to show post-booking progress.
2. Generate Ticket PDF.
3. Send ticket emails & notifications to `Customer`, `Organizer`, and `Admin`.
4. Complete the post-booking process and show a notification alert.

### Benefits of the Booking Process

- Independent pre-booking & post-booking processes
- Faster checkout and reduced waiting time
- More reliableâ€”if email sending fails, it won't affect other tasks
- Clear process tracking so users can contact support with specific issues
