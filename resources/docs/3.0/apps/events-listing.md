Discover events faster with a clean, organized listing built for browsing by interest. The Eventmie Pro FullyLoaded app groups every event into easy‑to‑scan categories, so you can jump straight to what you love—music, conferences, workshops, sports, meetups, and more. Each category showcases dates, venues, pricing, and highlights at a glance, helping you decide quickly and book with confidence.

## How many categories?
There’s no hard limit. Your marketplace can have as many categories as you need. Admins create and curate categories to match your brand and audience, keeping event discovery simple and consistent.

## Browse by category (how it works)
1. Open Events: See featured and trending events at the top.
2. Pick a Category: Tap a category (e.g., Music, Business, Education) to filter the list.
3. Refine Your Choice: Use search or other filters (date, price, location) to narrow results.
4. Open an Event: Review details, schedule, venue map, and ticket options.
5. Book in Seconds: Secure checkout with instant confirmation and QR‑code tickets.
