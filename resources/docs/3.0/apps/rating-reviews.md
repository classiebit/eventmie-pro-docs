# Rating & Reviews

Build trust and boost attendance with Ratings & Reviews in the Eventmie Pro FullyLoaded app. Attendees can rate events and share short reviews after they attend, creating authentic social proof that helps new buyers choose with confidence. High‑rated events rise to the top, while organizers get clear, actionable feedback to fine‑tune programming, hosts, and on‑site experience.

## Why it matters
1. Social proof that increases conversions and reduces hesitation at checkout.
2. Quality signals that highlight top events and trending experiences.
3. Practical feedback for organizers to improve content, timing, and operations.

## How it works
1. Attend the event and complete check‑in.
2. Leave a star rating and a short review from the event page.
3. See average ratings and recent comments displayed on event listings and detail pages.
