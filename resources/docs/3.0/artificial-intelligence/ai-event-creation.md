#### Overview
The AI Event Creation feature allows you to quickly set up events by simply describing them in plain language. For example, you can type:

The AI will generate the event details for you, making it perfect for:
- First-time organizers
- Small events (meetups, classes, local shows, community events)
- Quick event listings with simple ticketing

#### Key Benefits
- **Quick and easy setup:** Just type a prompt like "Create a 3‑day virtual marketing summit with breakout sessions and networking slots." The AI handles schedules, venues, ticket types, pricing, and session tracks.
- **Faster time-to-market:** Reduce manual setup and launch events faster, so you can focus on promotion and engagement.
- **Industry-standard defaults:** AI presets include tiered ticketing (Early Bird, General, VIP), secure payment gateway links, and attendee capacity planning.

#### How it Works
