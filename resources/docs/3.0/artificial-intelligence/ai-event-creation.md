# AI Event Creation

Eventmie Pro brings a game-changing Event Creation feature designed for event organizers and planners. Whether you're hosting a community gathering or a large-scale conference, you can now plan and launch your event in just minutes using a simple description. This tool is available for both Eventmie Pro and Eventmie Pro FullyLoaded platforms.

#### Overview
The AI Event Creation feature allows you to quickly set up events by simply describing them in plain language. For example, you can type:

---

**Example Prompt:** "I want to organise an event for old age peoples about how to look fit in old age. We only allowed 50+ age peoples in this event. This event will happen on 30th June 2025."

## How to get an OpenAI API key (current UI)

1. **Create or sign in to your OpenAI account**  
Go to the platform and sign in (the same account you use for the Playground).  
[OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview)

2. **(Recommended) Create a Project for Eventmie**  
In the left sidebar, open Settings → Projects and click New project (for example, “Eventmie-Prod”).  
Projects help you keep keys organized, set budgets, and separate production from development.

3. **Set up billing (once per organization)**  
Open Settings → Organization → Billing and add a payment method.

4. **Create the API key**  
In the left sidebar, open API Keys → choose the right Project → click + Create new secret key.  
Give it a clear name (for example, eventmie-prod-server). You can choose permissions (All / Restricted / Read-only), then Create.  
Copy the key once and save it in your secure vault—you won’t be able to view it again.

5. **Lock it down and organize**  
Prefer Restricted keys for tighter control and turn off anything you don’t use.  
Create separate keys for development, staging, and live environments, and separate by service if you want clearer cost tracking.

6. **Set usage limits and budgets (optional but smart)**  
In Project → Limits, set a monthly budget and request limits to prevent runaway costs.  
[OpenAI Help Center](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/9186755-managing-projects-in-the-api-platform?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

7. **Review data controls (optional)**  
In Settings → Data controls, review whether your organization shares evaluation or feedback data and adjust per project or organization as needed.
