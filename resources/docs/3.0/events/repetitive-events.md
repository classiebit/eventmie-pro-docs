## Seasonal Tickets

---

> {primary} New in v2.0 ðŸ”¥

---

For recurring schedules, you may want to accept payments on a `Monthly` or `Weekly` basis for all schedules within a month or week, instead of charging for each day separately.

Seasonal Tickets allow customers to purchase all tickets for a month or week at once, enabling them to attend every session with a single ticket.

<br>

This means customers pay a **Full Advance Payment** for a complete month or week schedule, making it easier to manage recurring event payments.

<br>

To enable this, check the `Seasonal Ticket` box (e.g., for `Repetitive Type: Monthly`). Then:

1. Set ticket prices for the entire month or week, not just a single session.
2. When a customer pays, you receive the full month's or week's payment upfront.

---

## Timeslots Availability

Easily check available timeslots for recurring event schedules. See if a timeslot is fully booked before proceeding to checkout.

1. In the Event Schedules, if all tickets for a specific timeslot/date are booked, that timeslot will display as **Out Of Stock**.

---

![Live Timeslots Availability Check](/images/v2/RepetitiveEventImages/repetitive-events-availability.webp "Live Timeslots Availability Check")

---

2. On the Checkout Popup, **Vacant Seats** are shown for each ticket if the **Total Available Ticket Quantity** is less than the **Max Ticket Qty Limit Per Order** (Admin Panel -> Settings -> Booking Tab -> Max Ticket Qty Limit Per Order).

This ensures only limited ticket availability is displayed, protecting your inventory details.
