## Seasonal Tickets (Full-Period Payments)

For recurring schedules, you can accept payments on a **Monthly** or **Weekly** basis, allowing customers to purchase all sessions for a period with a single ticket.

Seasonal Tickets allow customers to purchase all tickets for a month or week at once, enabling them to attend every session with a single ticket. 

This means customers pay a **Full Advance Payment** for a complete month or week schedule, making it easier to manage recurring event payments.

- **Seasonal Ticket:** Check this box to enable full-period payments.
- **Set Ticket Price:** Price covers all sessions in the selected period.
- **Full Advance Payment:** Customers pay upfront for the entire month or week.

## Timeslots Availability

Easily check available timeslots for recurring event schedules. See if a timeslot is fully booked before proceeding to checkout.

- **Live Timeslot Availability:** See which sessions are fully booked in real time.
- **Vacant Seats Display:** Show available seats per ticket, protecting your inventory details.


---
In the Event Schedules, if all tickets for a specific timeslot/date are booked, that timeslot will display as **Sold Out**.

![Live Timeslots Availability Check](/images/v3/repetitive-event-timeslot-availability.webp "Live Timeslots Availability Check")

---

On the Checkout Popup, **Vacant Seats** are shown for each ticket if the **Total Available Ticket Quantity** is less than the **Max Ticket Qty Limit Per Order** (Admin Panel -> Settings -> Booking Tab -> Max Ticket Qty Limit Per Order). This ensures only limited ticket availability is displayed, protecting your inventory details.
