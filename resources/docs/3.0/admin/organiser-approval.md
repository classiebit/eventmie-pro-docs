## Why Manual Organizer Approval Matters

Manual organizer approval is a critical feature for modern event platforms, ensuring only trusted, verified individuals or organizations can create and manage events. This protects your platform from fraud, spam, and low-quality events, while building attendee trust and safeguarding your brand reputation.

### Key Benefits:

1. **Fraud Prevention:** Block fake or malicious organizers before they can create events.
2. **Quality Control:** Maintain high standards for events listed on your platform.
3. **Compliance:** Meet legal and regulatory requirements (KYC, AML, etc.).
4. **Brand Protection:** Ensure only reputable organizers represent your platform.
5. **Custom Vetting:** Collect additional information or documents as needed.

### Common Use Cases

1. **Public Event Marketplaces:** Open platforms where anyone can apply, but only vetted organizers are approved to host events.
2. **Corporate/Internal Events:** Restrict event creation to approved departments or staff for internal company events.
3. **Education & Training:** Only certified trainers or institutions can create and manage courses or workshops.
4. **Fundraising & Nonprofits:** Ensure only legitimate organizations can host fundraising or charity events.
5. **High-Value or Regulated Events:** For events with financial, legal, or compliance implications, manual approval is essential.
