## Professional Email Delivery Setup: 100% Deliverability Guaranteed

Email deliverability is critical for event notifications, ticketing, and customer engagement. While popular email services like Mailgun, Brevo, Postmark, SendGrid, and Resend offer robust infrastructure, their default configurations often fail to ensure inbox placement across all major email clients—especially with providers like Hotmail, Yahoo, and custom domain mailboxes.

<br>

**Why Standard Email Setups Fall Short:**
- Out-of-the-box settings may result in emails landing in spam or being rejected by strict providers.
- Many email clients require advanced authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC), custom domain alignment, and reputation management.
- Deliverability issues can impact ticket sales, event reminders, and customer trust.

<br>

**Our Solution: Professional Email Configuration**

- We provide expert setup and advanced configuration of your chosen email service (Mailgun, Brevo, Postmark, SendGrid, Resend, etc.).
- Implementation of all required DNS records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC, CNAME, tracking domains) for your sending domain.
- Custom domain authentication and alignment for maximum trust and inbox placement.
- Testing and verification to ensure your emails reach all major clients—including Gmail, Outlook, Hotmail, Yahoo, and custom domains.
- Ongoing monitoring and support for deliverability issues.
