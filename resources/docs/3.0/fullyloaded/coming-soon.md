# Coming Soon Events

Eventmie Pro FullyLoaded introduces a Coming Soon publishing mode for organizers who want to announce an event before finalizing the schedule and tickets. Publish a clean, SEO-friendly event page without date, time, or ticket details, then add them later when you are ready.

## How It Works

**Step 1:** In your organizer dashboard, go to the events section, click "Create Event," and enable the Coming Soon option to publish without schedule and tickets.

**Step 2:** Enter the essentialsâ€”event name, web link, summary, description, categories, cover image, and visibility. Date/time and tickets are not required.

**Step 3:** Publish the event. Your public event page shows a clear Coming Soon status and hides the schedule and tickets until you add them.

**Step 4:** When details are confirmed, edit the event to add the schedule and ticket options. Turning off Coming Soon reveals the standard sections immediately, keeping the same event URL.
