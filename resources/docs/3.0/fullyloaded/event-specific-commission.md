# Event-specific Commission

Easily set unique admin commission rates for each event in Eventmie Pro FullyLoaded. This feature allows you to tailor commission settings for individual events, giving you greater control over your event management and revenue strategy.

<br>

Only Admins can assign a specific admin commission to each event from the Event Edit Page using the Event Specific Admin field. This makes it simple to offer special commission rates for certain events or partners.

Admins can set the commission to 0 to make an event commission-free. If the `Event Specific Admin` field is left empty, the system will automatically apply the default admin commission rate set in the global settings to all bookings for that event.
