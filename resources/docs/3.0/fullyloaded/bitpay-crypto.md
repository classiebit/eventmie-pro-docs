## How to Setup Test BitPay (Practice Mode)

You can only set up BitPay on a live website (not on localhost). Please upload your website to your live domain before starting.

Now, let's set up Test BitPay for practice payments. The live BitPay setup is the same as test. Make sure you create a BitPay merchant account for both environments.

1. Login to your website as Admin and go to Admin Panel -> Settings -> Apps tab.
2. Enter:
    - BitPay Key Name: Enter a new random value (e.g. AbcXyzzMedia)
    - BitPay Encrypt Code: Enter a new random secret code (e.g. KJHakj879&*kjkjh)
    - Keep BitPay Production Off
