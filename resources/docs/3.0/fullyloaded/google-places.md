# Google Places Autocomplete & Directions Integration for Eventmie Pro FullyLoaded

Enable Google Places Autocomplete and Directions to streamline event venue location entry and provide attendees with instant directions in your Eventmie Pro FullyLoaded Laravel event management platform. This feature automates Google Map location search and auto-fills event venue details, improving accuracy and user experience.
