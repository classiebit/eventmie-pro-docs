Enable auto-login and instant checkout for unregistered users in your Eventmie Pro FullyLoaded Laravel event management platform. Unregistered users can book tickets directly by registering on the go—just click Guest Checkout, enter name, email, and phone number, and complete the booking in seconds.

Within the Checkout popup, users can log in, register, or checkout as a guest—all in the same window, with no redirects. This streamlined process improves ticket purchasing for guests and increases event sales.

Guest accounts are created instantly from the Checkout popup. Users receive both a successful signup and booking confirmation email.

Later, guests can log in with the same email by resetting their password using the Forgot Password option.
