# Promocodes & Discount Codes in Eventmie Pro FullyLoaded

Create and manage discount promocodes that customers can apply to event tickets during checkout in your Eventmie Pro FullyLoaded Laravel event management platform. Boost ticket sales and event marketing with flexible coupon options for both admins and organizers.

As Admin, you can create multiple promocodes with different configurationsâ€”fixed or percentage-based discounts, usage limits, and more.

Organizers can assign any of these promocodes to their event tickets, even using different codes for each ticket. They can then promote these codes to their audience for special discounts.

Attendees can apply promocodes at checkout to receive instant ticket discounts.
