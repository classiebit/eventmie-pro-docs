# Advanced Ticket Scanner (FullyLoaded)

The FullyLoaded ticket scanner is engineered for high-traffic, high-security events—delivering a seamless, hands-free check-in experience that goes far beyond standard QR scanning.

## Key Features
- **Hands-Free Wall-Mounted Scanning:**
  - Mount a tablet or mobile device at the entrance, open the scanner in the browser, and let attendees self-scan their tickets—no staff required at the device.
- **Visual Feedback for Security:**
  - **Green screen:** Valid check-in—attendee can enter.
  - **Red screen:** Invalid ticket—entry denied.
  - **Orange screen:** Ticket already checked-in—bouncer can decide based on event policy.
- **Group Check-In:**
  - Scan one QR code to check in an entire group or family—no need to scan each ticket individually.
- **Device Compatibility:**
  - Works with tablets, smartphones, and dedicated scanning devices (Zebra, Honeywell, etc.)
- **Optimized for Speed:**
  - Designed for large events, stadiums, and venues with high attendee flow.

## How It Works
1. Set up your device at the entry point and open the scanner in the browser.
2. Attendees scan their tickets themselves.
3. The screen color instantly indicates the result—making it easy for security staff to monitor from a distance.
4. For group check-in, one scan checks in all linked tickets.

## Group Check-In: Real-World Example
Imagine a family of five arrives at your event. Instead of scanning five separate tickets, the parent scans one group QR code—instantly checking in the entire family. This saves time, reduces entry lines, and improves the attendee experience for large groups or teams.
