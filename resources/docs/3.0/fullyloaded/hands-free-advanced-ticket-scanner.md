## How It Works
1. Set up your device at the entry point and open the scanner in the browser.
2. Guests scan their tickets themselves.
3. The screen color instantly indicates the result—making it easy for security staff to monitor from a distance.
4. For group check-in, one scan checks in all linked tickets.
