2. After extracting `eventmie-pro-webinstaller.zip` in your website directory, go to that directory.
3. Open the `.env` file at the root (e.g., `public_html/.env`) and enter your database credentials:

    ```php
        DB_DATABASE=<database-name>
        DB_USERNAME=<database-user-username>
        DB_PASSWORD=<database-user-password>
    ```

3. Visit your website URL. When prompted, enter your license code and click Proceed.
4. After successful license verification, you'll be redirected to the Eventmie Pro web-installer steps form.
5. Follow the on-screen steps:

    * **Step-1: Check server requirements** <br>
    The installer will automatically check your server requirements and highlight any missing PHP extensions. If any are missing, install them or contact your hosting provider. Refresh the page after resolving any issues.

    If you see a red cross, change the permissions for the `storage` and `bootstrap` folders (details provided on the installer page.)

<a name="installation-errors"></a>
## Installation Errors

1. If you encounter the error `1071 Specified key was too long;` during installation, it's due to an older MySQL version. To resolve:

* Go to `config/database.php` and update the `mysql` section as follows:

    ```php
    'charset'   => 'utf8',
    'collation' => 'utf8_unicode_ci',
    'strict'    => false,
    'engine'    => 'InnoDB ROW_FORMAT=DYNAMIC',
    ```


2. If you're running MySQL `5.7` or older, disable strict mode in the `mysql` section of `config/database.php`:

    ```php
    'strict'    => false,
    ```

3. If you get a `classiebit/eventmie-pro package not found error`, it may be due to the `symlink` feature being disabled on some hosts. To fix:

- Delete the `classiebit` folder inside the `vendor` directory and run `composer update` in your website's root directory.
