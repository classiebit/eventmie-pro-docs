Duplicate existing events to speed up creating a new event, rather than creating them from scratch.

1. If you're logged in as Admin then, go to Admin Panel -> Events and click **More**.
2. If you're logged in as Organizer then go to **Manage Events**.
3. On the **Manage Events** page, you'll find Clone Event, click on it to **Clone Event**.

The cloned event will have everything except the bookings. And it'll be cloned as unpublished, so that you can make some changes into it before publishing.
