# Event-specific Commission

Set different admin commission for each event. Only Admin can set different Admin Commission for each event from Event Edit Page -> Event Specific Admin

<br>

Admin can set it to 0 to make an event admin commission free. And if you leave the `Event Specific Admin` empty, then the default Admin Commission that's set on Admin commission, will be applied on all the events bookings.
