## Install via Web-Installer

Eventmie Pro also comes with web-installer for those, who are not familiar with the Laravel framework. The web-installer installs Eventmie Pro directly on the web-server in few clicks. No technical or coding skills needed.

---

>{primary} Extract the `eventmie-pro-webinstaller.zip` inside the website directory e.g `public_html` or `www`.

---

![Eventmie Web Installer](/images/installation-web-installer.jpg "Eventmie Web Installer")

---

>{primary} Web-installer installs everything - Laravel Framework + Eventmie Pro package + composer dependencies.

---

Follow these simple steps for getting started with web-installer.

1. Create a database on the CPANEL/server and copy the database credentials- `database name`, `username` & `password`.
2. Then after extracting `eventmie-pro-webinstaller.zip` in the website directory, go to the website directory. 
3. Open the `.env` file at the root `public_html/.env` and enter the database credentials. 

    ```php
        DB_DATABASE=<database-name>
        DB_USERNAME=<database-user-username>
        DB_PASSWORD=<database-user-password>
    ```

3. Visit the website URL. It'll ask for the License code, enter it and click Proceed.
4. After successful license verification, it'll redirect to the Eventmie Pro web-installer steps form.
5. In the steps form, things are self-explanatory.

    * **Step-1: Check server requirements** <br>
    It'll auto check the webserver requirements, and will point out if any PHP extension is missing. If in case of missing extensions, you need your web server/hosting provider or install missing PHP extension yourself. After installing missing PHP extensions, return to the installer page and refresh.

    
    * **Step-2: Check Folder Permissions** <br> 
    If you see some red cross. Change two folder permissions `storage` & `bootstrap`. (you'll see more info about this on the installer page.)

    * **Step-3: Final Step** <br>
    Enter Website Name & URL and Click Install.

<a name="installation-errors"></a>
## Installation Errors

* Go to file `config/database.php` and change these values in `mysql` section

    ```php
    'charset'   => 'utf8',
    'collation' => 'utf8_unicode_ci',
    'strict'    => false,
    'engine'    => 'InnoDB ROW_FORMAT=DYNAMIC',
    ```

    'strict'    => false,
    ```
