# Tags

In v1.2.0, Speakers & Sponsors are replaced by a more powerful and dynamic feature called Tags. Now you can add unlimited types of Tags (e.g speakers, sponsors, hosts, DJs, etc) and link them to an Event.

<br>

Multiple tags can belong to an event. And each tag belongs to an organizer ðŸ˜´. Basically, Organizer can add tags, and link them to their events.  

<br>

```bash
                        -> Tag-1
                        -> Tag-2
Organizer-1 -> Event-1  -> Tag-3
                        -> Tag-4
                        -> Tag-5
```

<br>

Admin can manage all organizers tags from Admin Panel -> Tags. While Organizer can manage their tags from front-end.

<br>

1. On the header, hover over the account name and click on `Manage Tags`.
2. Click on &nbsp;<larecipe-button type="danger" size="sm" rounded>Add Tag</larecipe-button>
3. In the popup, fill in the details and click on &nbsp;<larecipe-button type="danger" size="sm" rounded>Save</larecipe-button>
