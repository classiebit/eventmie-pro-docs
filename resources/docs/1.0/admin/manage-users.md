# Manage Users

All the site users can be managed from this page. There are three prefined user groups -


1. Admin - only user group that is allowed to visit the admin panel

2. Organizers - can create and manage their events and bookings from the front-end only.

3. Customers - can book events and manage their bookings and cancellations from the front-end.


> {primary} Admin can change the role of a user to `Admin` `Organizer` or `Customer`
