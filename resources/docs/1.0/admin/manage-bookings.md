## Bookings

As an Admin you can see all the bookings from the customers on this page.

### Create New Booking

You can create new booking for a customer from the front-end only. We have tried to not to repeat the same functionality on the admin panel that is already available on the frontend. Instead, we just developed a strong roles and permisions system on the front-end. So that Admin, Organiser and customer can only do what they are supposed to do.

### Edit Booking

You can only update an existing booking cancellation status and booking status. 

- Cancellation status is for tracking the cancellation progress if it's `pending`, `approved` or the booking about has been `refunded` to the customer.
- Status is to force enable or disable the booking.
