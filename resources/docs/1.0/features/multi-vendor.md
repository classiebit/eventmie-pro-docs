# Multi Vendor

Eventmie Pro comes with multi-vendor support. Mean, you can turn `On` or `Off` the multi-vendor functionality. If you're a single organisation and want to host only your own events, then you can turn `Off` the `Multi-vendor` option from the admin panel settings.

<br>

#### But if you're planning to invite other organisers on your website to create and host their own events and you want to earn commission on each ticket, then you can turn `On` the `Multi-vendor` option.

## Organiser Guidelines

Below are some guidelines what an Organiser **can** and **cannot** do.

1. Organiser **cannot** be able to become Customer again. The process is `irreversible`
2. Organiser **can** create and manage their **own** events only, but **cannot** book any event (only for their own).
3. Organiser **can** book only their **own** events for any other Customer (users) of the site.
4. Organisers **can** manage bookings of their **own** events only.
