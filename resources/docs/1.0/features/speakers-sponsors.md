# Speakers & Sponsors

Multiple speakers and sponsors can belong to an event. And each speaker and sponsor belongs to an organizer ðŸ˜´. Basically, Organizer can add speakers & sponsors, and link them to their events.

```bash

                        -> Speaker-1
Organizer-1 -> Event-1  -> Speaker-2
                        -> Speaker-3


                        -> Sponsor-1
Organizer-1 -> Event-1  -> Sponsor-2
                        -> Sponsor-3
