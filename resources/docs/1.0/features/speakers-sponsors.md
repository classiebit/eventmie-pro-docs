# Speakers & Sponsors

You can add speakers and sponsors to your events. Each speaker and sponsor belongs to an organiser. So an organiser can add speakers and sponsors to their own events.

<br>
```bash

                        -> Speaker-1
Organiser-1 -> Event-1  -> Speaker-2
                        -> Speaker-3


                        -> Sponsor-1
Organiser-1 -> Event-1  -> Sponsor-2
                        -> Sponsor-3


```
