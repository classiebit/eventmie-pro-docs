# Commission

Eventmie is a flexible event hosting solution. You can use it as a multi-vendor website or as a single organisation website. 

<br>
In case of multi-vendor, you as a website owner can call event organisers to signup and create events on your website, and then need a commission system, using which you can keep some margin from each `Paid` ticket and earn profit.

<br>
This is a `semi-automatic` commission system in which you can set your commission in percentage from `Admin panel -> Settings -> Commission` and then the commission on each booking will be calculated and recorded in the commission module.

<br>
At first, all ticket sales amount will go into website owner's account and then the owner will distribute the amount to each organiser manually and can update the `transfer` status on the commission module.


> {primary} We're gonna add more functionality to this commission system in the next upcoming version.
