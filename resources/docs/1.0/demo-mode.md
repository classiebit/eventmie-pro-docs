# Demo Mode

To provide a seamless experience to new visitors and regular visitors, we've developed a completely visitors centric demo mode. So you as a new and regular visitor, you can checkout Anofie's all features with a very few boundations, even you can visit `Admin panel` anytime.

> {primary} The best part is, we do not refresh the database to clear the visitors dummy data. We keep your dummy data so that you can test with it anytime.

We've created some `demo accounts` and added `demo data` into them to showcase all the features of Anofie. 

1. If you've logged in using a demo account, then you only have `read and write permission`, and no `delete or modify permission`.

2. If you've Signup and login as a new user, then you have all the permissions `read, write, delete and modify`.

## Demo Accounts

Below are all the demo accounts and their credentials. If you want to test in any specific language, then there's also a solution for that.
We've mentioned language preference after each demo account, `e.g Roman Pane (Russian)`, so after login using this account please change the language to `Russian` to see everything in `Russian`
