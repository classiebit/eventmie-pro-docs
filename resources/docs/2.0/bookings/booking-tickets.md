## Paid or UnPaid Booking

Added a new & very important `Booking Status` called `Is Paid` - `Yes` or `No`. It shows, whether the booking amount has been paid by the customer or not.

<br>

As there are having different types of `Payment Options`, the `Is Paid` status varies accordingly-

1. **Free Checkout**- `Is Paid` status is always `Yes`.
2. **Online Payment**- `Is Paid` status is always `Yes`.
3. **Offline Payment**- `Is Paid` status is always `No`.

After receiving the payment in case of `Offline Payment`, Admin, or Organizer can update the `Is Paid` status to `Yes`.

## Booking Process (under the hood)

Let's see, what exactly makes the booking & checkout process so faster & smoother. The below info is just to show you, what's going on under the hood.

The booking process is separated into two parts (micro-services). When you click on the Checkout button, below is a list of all processes that take place under the hood.

### Pre-booking process

1. Initiate a progress loader that shows checkout progress.
2. Validate the booking, if fails, stop the process and throw an error.
3. If successful, start processing payment.
4. On successful payment, finish the booking process. (finish pre-booking process).
5. Show successful payment & booking notification alert and redirect to `My Bookings Page`.

---

>{primary} There are separate `My Bookings` pages for Customers, Organizers & Admin, which shows all bookings. We'll discuss in the `Manage Bookings` section.

---

### Post-booking process

1. On the bookings page, initiate a progress loader that shows post-booking progress.
2. Generate Ticket PDF.
3. Send Ticket emails & notifications to `Customer`, `Organizer` & `Admin`.
4. Finally, finish the post-booking process and show notification alert.


### Benefits of the Booking Process

- Independent pre-booking & post-booking processes.
- Faster checkout, lesser waiting time.
- More reliable, e.g if email sending fails, it won't affect other related tasks.
- For more clarity for each task, a user can track each process and can contact support about the exact issue.
