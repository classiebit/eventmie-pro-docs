# Commissions

Eventmie Pro is a flexible event hosting solution. You can use it as a Multi-organization (multi-vendor) or as a single organization website.

<br>

In the case of the multi-vendor, you as a website owner can invite event organizers to signup and create events on your website. And that's where you'll also need a commission system, for sharing the profit.

<br>

So, here's a **semi-automatic** commission system in which you can set `commission percentage (%)` from Admin Panel, and then commissions on each booking will be calculated automatically.

<br>

At first, all bookings credit goes to the website owner's (Admin) bank account and then the owner distributes the organizer's payout manually and can update the `Payout Transfer` status on the Admin Panel.

<br>

Eventmie Pro makes the payout transfer system as smooth as cheese ðŸ§€. Follow the below guidelines, and you'll become master in it, in no time.

<a name="commission-calculations"></a>
## Commission Calculations

This is how, the Admin Commission and Organizer earnings are calculated behind the scenes. Let us explain from an example.

<br>

|Payables|Rates|Calculations|Total|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Ticket Price (TP)|$100|$100|$100|
|Organizer Tax (OT)|5% + 5%|(5% of $100) + (5% of $100)|$10|
|Admin Commission (AC)|5%|5% of ($100 + $10)|$5.5|
|Admin Tax (AT)|3% + 3%|(3% of $100) + (3% of $100)|$6|

---

>{primary} Admin Commission = 5% of (Ticket Price + Organizer Tax)

---

>{primary} Admin Tax won't be a part of Organizer earning. It'll completely go to Admin account.

---

|Total Customer Paid|Total Organizer Earning|Total Admin Commission|
|:-|:-|:-|
|TP + OT + AC + AT|(TP + OT) - AC|AC + AT|
|$100 + $10 + $6 + $5 = $121|$110 - $5.5 = 104.5|$5.5 + $6 = $11.5|

---


1. In case of **Online Payment** the **Is Paid** is set to **Yes**, while in case of Offline/Direct payment, Organizer or Admin needs to update the **Is Paid** status to **Yes**. The bookings will appear in Commissions only after the **Is Paid = Yes**.

2. If a booking is made after making the Organizer Earning's **Transferred** status set to **Yes**, then that new booking of the same month will appear as a new entry in Commission, as **Un-Transferred** payout.

3. Once, the **Un-Transferred** Organiser earning for the same month is set to **Transferred**, then it'll be merged in one single **Transferred** Payout for the month.

4. The commission will record and show the overall calculations with floating-point precision.


<a name="refunds-settlements"></a>
## Refunds Settlements

In case of booking cancellations & refunds regarding the Organizer payouts, that has already been transferred, then the refunded amount will come into **Refund Settlement** that needs to be claimed back from the Organiser.

- Admin can also mark a Refund Settlement status to **Yes**, which shows that the refunded booking has been claimed back from the Organizer payout.

## Multi Vendor On

Eventmie Pro supports a single organization and multi-organization (multi-vendor, like a SaaS platform). You can toggle between these two modes with a click of a button from the `Admin Panel -> Settings -> Multi-vendor` tab.

<br>

2. Organizer **CAN** create and manage their **own** events, but **CANNOT** book any event for their **own**.

    ---

    >{primary} While Admin can do anything, without any limitations.

    ---


<a name="multi-vendor-off"></a>
## Multi Vendor Off

When the multi-vendor mode is `Off`, then on the front-end, all the options for `Become Organizer`, `Create Event` or anything else related to `multi-vendor` functionality, get invisible. In that case, Admin manages everything on behalf of an Organizer.

<br>

Admin can create a separate `User` from the admin panel and assign the `User` the `Organizer - Role`. Follow these steps to do so.

1. Go to `Admin Panel -> Manage Users`.

2. Click on &nbsp;<larecipe-badge type="primary" rounded>Add New</larecipe-badge>

3. Fill in the Organizer's name, email, and password (you can fill your own).

4. Select the `Default Role` to `Organizer`.

    ---

    >{primary} After creating an organizer, Admin can use the organizer everywhere, whenever it asks to `Select Organizer`.

    ---



<a name="zero-commission"></a>
## ZERO Commission

When you set the Admin Commission to ZERO, it calculates the Organizer payouts with ZERO commission and shows all the payouts on the **Admin Panel -> Commissions** page.

- In case of ZERO commission, Admin can still set Admin Tax, and all the detailed payout info will be shown on Admin Commission & Organizer earning page.

- If a booking is deleted, refunded, or disabled, you'll see proper effects and changes in the Admin Commission & Organizer Earnings.
