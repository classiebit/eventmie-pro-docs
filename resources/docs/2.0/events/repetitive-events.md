## Seasonal Tickets

---

> {primary} New in v2.0 ðŸ”¥

---

In the case of repetitive schedules, sometimes you want to get paid on a `Monthly` or `Weekly` basis for all schedules within a `Month or Week`, instead of each day separately.

Seasonal Tickets means, customer purchase the whole month tickets at once and they can attend event with single ticket.

<br>

This means the customer can attend the event for the whole month or week, by paying a **Full Advance Payment** for a complete month or week schedule.

<br>

For this kind of scenario, here's the `Seasonal Ticket Feature` to the rescue. ðŸ¥°

<br>

Let's get started. Check the `Seasonal Ticket` checkbox, e.g for the `Repetitive Type: Monthly` type of event. After that-

1. Set the ticket prices for whole month schedules, instead of a single schedule.
2. When a customer makes the payment, you get a whole month's payment instead of a single schedule.

---

**This is how Monthly Repetitive Schedules with Seasonal Ticket option checked, look like**

<a name="timeslots-availability"></a>

## Timeslots Availability

Check available timeslots for repetitive event schedules on the go. You can now see if a timeslot is fully booked or not for any specific date before clicking on the Checkout button.

1. In the Event Schedules, if all the tickets have been booked for a specific timeslot/date, then it'll show that timeslot as **Out Of Stock**.

---

![Live Timeslots Availability Check](https://eventmie-pro-docs.classiebit.com/images/v2/RepetitiveEventImages/repetitive-events-availability.png "Live Timeslots Availability Check")

---

2. On the Checkout Popup, it'll show **Vacant Seats** for every ticket, only if the **Total Available Ticket Quantity** of the ticket is less than **Max Ticket Qty Limit Per Order** (Admin Panel -> Settings -> Booking Tab -> Max Ticket Qty Limit Per Order).

In this way, it won't disclose all the Quantity of the ticket and only show the vacant seats in case of lesser availability.
