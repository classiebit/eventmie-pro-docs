# Guest Checkout

> {primary} Improved Guest Checkout feature in v2.0

---

Auto-login and checkout for unregistered users. Unregistered users can directly make booking by registering on the go. They'll simply need to click on Guest Checkout and enter their name, email and phone number and that's it.

<br>

Now within the Checkout popup, user can Login, Register or checkout as Guest can do all within the same popup window and it won't redirect the user anywhere.
This will improve the Ticket purchasing for Guests.

<br>

Their account will be created directly from the Checkout popup and they'll recieve successful Signup and Booking successful email.

<br>

And later on, they can login with same email after resetting their password using Forgot Password.
