# POS & Scanner & Manager

To create separate user groups with limited access like a sub-organizer who can manage things like bookings, check-in, selling on behalf of Organizer. POS can sell tickets on Event entrance, Scanner can scan tickets and Manager can manage everything on behalf of Organizer.

<br>

POS, Scanner & Manager all these are sub-organizers, who have limited access. These sub-organizers are created by Organizer and are assigned by Organizers to their specific events. And all organizers can create their own sub-organizers, and then the sub-organizers can access the only events to which they're assigned to.

<br>

The Manager (sub-organizer) have power than POS & Scanner. The Organizer can create a Manager, and then, that Manager can do everything on behalf of the Organizer.
