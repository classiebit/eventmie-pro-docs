# Ticket Scanner

Eventmie Pro comes with integrated ticket scanner. Organizers & Admin can scan the event attendees tickets at event entrances directly from the website, using any mobile device or laptop with a web-camera.

The ticket scanner scans QrCode on the ticket, verify if ticket is valid, and provides an option to `Check-in` the attendees. Once a ticket is scanned, it can never be scanned again after `Check-in`.

>{primary} In `v1.4`, we've improved the Ticket PDF design & Ticket scanner performance. It scans ticket within a Blink. 😎

## Ticket PDF

Before proceeding to Ticket scanner, let's see the Ticket PDF. Eventmie Pro generates tickets in PDF format with a unique QrCode in each.

- QrCode has got a unique Ticket ID + Order number, which belongs to a single customer's ticket.
- Ticket format is PDF, hence it's compatible by default on all devices.
- QrCode size on the ticket is increased, hence, the scanning is faster, and you don't even need to `Zoom in`.
- `Admin` | `Organizer` | `Customer`, all of them can download tickets from their `Bookings` page.
