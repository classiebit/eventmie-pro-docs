## Monthly/Weekly Payment

---

>{primary} Don't worry, we haven't missed this one. ðŸ˜‰

---

In case of repetitive schedules, sometimes you want to get paid on a `Monthly` or `Weekly` basis for all schedules within a `Month or Week`, instead of each day separately. 

<br>

This means the customer can attend the event for the whole month or week, by paying a **Full Advance Payment** for a complete month or week schedules. 

<br>

For this kind of scenario, here's the `Monthly or Weekly Payment` to the rescue. ðŸ¥°

<br>

Let's get started. Check the `Monthly or Weekly Payment` checkbox, e.g for `Repetitive Type: Monthly` type of event. After that-

1. Set the ticket prices for whole month schedules, instead of a single schedule.
2. When a customer makes the payment, you get a whole month payment instead of a single schedule.
