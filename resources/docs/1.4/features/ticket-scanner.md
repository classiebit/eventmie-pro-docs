QrCode requires the below things to work-

1. HTTPS (SSL Certificate) enabled website.
2. The device must have a camera/web-camera.
3. Browser permission to Allow Camera.

---

>{info} On the QrCode scanner page, it automatically opens a prompt to **Allow Camera**. Once you allow the camera, it never prompts again and works seamlessly.

---

>{primary} If the browser does not prompt to **Allow Camera** (this happens rarely), you need to go to browser settings and manually allow the camera.

---

>{success} In v1.3.0, we've added an alert notification, which shows when there's no camera or camera permission not given.
