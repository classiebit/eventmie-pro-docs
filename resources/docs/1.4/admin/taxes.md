## Admin Taxes <small class="v">*v1.4*</small>

When Admin set a tax as `Admin Tax`, it becomes `Admin Tax`. Let's see the powers of it.

1. Admin tax is invisible to organisers. 
3. Admin can create multiple Admin Taxes.
2. It's applied by default to all Events tickets.
4. Admin tax aplicable amount will go to Admin only, and won't be a part of Commission calculation & organiser earnings.
5. It's a seperate tax that's charged by Admin to the customers.
