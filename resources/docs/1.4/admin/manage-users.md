# Manage Users

All the site users can be managed from this page. There are three prefined user groups -


1. Admin - only user group that is allowed to visit the admin panel

2. Organizers - can create and manage their events and bookings from the front-end only.

3. Customers - can book events and manage their bookings and cancellations from the front-end.

### Disable User Account

When you disable a user from the Admin Panel, the disabled user can't be able to log in. The user sees "Account disabled error." while login.
